# Polygon Area API

## üìå Description
The Polygon Area API is a simple Flask-based API that calculates the area of regular polygons with 3 to 10 sides (triangle up to decagon).  
It accepts either query parameters (GET)  or JSON data (POST) and returns the result in JSON format.

This project was built as part of our API development requirement and demonstrates how to build and consume a custom API.

 üöÄ Features
- Calculate area of regular polygons (triangle ‚Üí decagon).
- Supports both **GET** and **POST** requests.
- Returns clean **JSON** responses.
- Easy to extend for more polygons or additional geometry functions.
